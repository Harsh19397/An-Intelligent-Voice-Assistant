# An-Intelligent-Voice-Assistant
An Intelligent voice assistant is an application that can understand voice commands and completes the task for user. Some of the examples of this application are Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant. Here, I have build a prototype of the same appplication with some functionalities which can be extended by anyone according to their needs. It takes user's voice as input, process them and performs actions based on it. It uses state of art process in Speech to Text, Natural language understanding, deep learning and Text to Speech. I have created 5 different modules for this prototype which are integrated together to make this prototype a successful one. These 4 modules are responsible for handling all the key functinalities. These modules are:
  1.  Deep Speaker - Responsible for recognising the speakers voice.
  2.  Intent Detection - Responsible for detecting the intent of the user.
  3.  Trigger word detection - Responsible for detecting the trigger when the user speaks the hot word.
  4.  Speech to Text - Responsible for recognising the voice commands of the user.
  5.  Text to Speech - Responsible for converting the text to speech to interact with the user.
